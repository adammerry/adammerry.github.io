             <p>The lion is known as "king of the jungle", and that nickname exists for a reason. These bad boys
             are known to feed on everything from birds and reptiles to wildebeests, zebras, and even elephants. 10,000 years
             ago the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans, but due to habitat loss and conflicts with
             humans they are now classified as a vulnerable species.</p>

              <p>Even though lions may be "king of the jungle", tigers (on average, their sizes can vary widely)
              are actually the largest living cat. They only naturally exist in asia, and can have unique color variations
              from white to orange to gold. Tigers are one of only two big cats that are fond of water, the other being jaguars. </p>

              <p>Jaguars are the only non-extinct big cats in the Panthera species (which encompasses
              lions, tigers, jaguars and leopards) native to the Americas. They are the third largest feline, after
              lions and tigers. Jaguar's exceptionally strong bite allows them to bite directly through the skull and fatally pierce
              the brains of their prey.</p>

            <div id="myCheetahDropDown" class="dropdown-content">
              <p>Cheetahs have a lighter, more slender body compared to other big cats, which is built for speed. They generally inhabit
              forests and savannahs in Africa and western Asia. The cheetah is the fastest land animal on earth, and can go from 0 to
              60 mph in 3 seconds, with their top speed being around 70 mph.</p>

            <div id="myCougarDropDown" class="dropdown-content">
              <p>The cougar, also known as the mountain lion, panther, puma, or catamount (yeah they're all the same thing) is
              more closely related to the domestic house cat than any of the Panthera genus (lion, tiger, jaguar, and leopard.
              Their range extends from the Canadian Yukon to the Southern Andes Mountains. Althought large, the cougar is
              sometimes preyed on by jaguars, wolves, and bears.</p>
